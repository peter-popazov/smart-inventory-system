# Inventory Management System

## Abstract:
The coursework presents the development of a system for efficient warehouse stock management. The primary goal is to enable users to monitor inventory levels, receive low-stock alerts, analyze product movement, and generate statistical reports to streamline business processes.

## Technical Highlights:
* Architecture: Microservice-based, implemented with Spring Boot.
* Databases: PostgreSQL and MongoDB for robust and scalable data storage.
* Communication: Apache Kafka, HTTP requests
* Frontend: React and Tailwind CSS for a responsive and user-friendly interface.
* Development Focus: REST API design, database integration, notification system setup, and testing.

## Outcomes:
* Developed features include adding/editing product and warehouse data, tracking inventory movements, automated low-stock alerts via email, and generating detailed statistical reports.
* Optimized for industries like retail, logistics, manufacturing, and e-commerce.
